## Project 1: FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments
Our first project work named "FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments". The work in this paper has been published at the EAI MobiQuitous 2022, where you can find the paper, source code in the folder "2022"

### Datasets used in the FedGroup Project
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the UNSW IoT analytics team, which is cited in the published paper below. We have pre-processed the UNSW IoT Analytics dataset for the context of our research project FedGroup. Our processed dataset and the corresponding code can be found in this GitHub repo "2022" - FL_attack_or_not.ipynb. If you use this dataset and/or the course code, cite the following research paper:
