# FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments

Hello and welcome this project repository!

In this research work we introduce our Federated Learning approach, FedGroup, for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments. The details of this research project are shared for further development and improvements in releated research areas. The work can be re-used and extended under the specified license ().   


# FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments

Our first project work named "FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments". The work in this paper has been published at the EAI MobiQuitous 2022, where you can find the paper, source code in the folder "2022"

### Original Data
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the UNSW IoT analytics team, which is cited in the published paper. 
Link to the original data: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/attack-data.html. Under "Instructions", "Flow Data" and "Annotations" are two folders of original datasets. 
"Flow data" contains flow counters of MUD flow, each instance in the file are collected every one minute.
"Annotations" contains information about the start, end time of the attack and corresponsing MUD flows that are impacted through the Attack.

If you use the the original dataset, cite the corresponding paper below:

# ************************ Project 2 ***********************************
# Privacy-Aware Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments using FedGroup: A Group-Based Federated Learning Approach

"Privacy-Aware Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments using FedGroup: A Group-Based Federated Learning Approach" is the extended study of our project 1 work. All project releated information can be found in the folder "2023"

### Original Dataset
The dataset used in this project (project 2) was obtained from the UNSW IoT analytics team, and we cited the data properly in the paper. Link to the original data: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/attack-data.html. Under "Instructions", "Flow Data" and "Annotations" are two folders of original datasets. Cit the following paper is you use the original dataset.
