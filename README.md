Hello and welcome this project repository!

In this research work we introduce our Federated Learning approach, FedGroup, for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments. The details of this research project are shared for further development and improvements in releated research areas. The work can be re-used and extended under the specified license (AGPL3.0). The work is split into two main projects each of which is published as per the below details.  

## Project 1: FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments

Our first project work named "FedGroup: A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments". The work in this paper has been published at the EAI MobiQuitous 2022, where you can find the paper, source code in the folder "Project 1 FedGroup A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments"

### Datasets used in the FedGroup Project 
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the UNSW IoT analytics team, which is cited in the published paper below.
We have pre-processed the UNSW IoT Analytics dataset for the context of our research project FedGroup. Our processed dataset and the corresponding code can be found in this GitHub repo "Project 1 FedGroup A Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environments" - FL_attack_or_not.ipynb. If you use this dataset and/or the course code, cite the following research paper:
